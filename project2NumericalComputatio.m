%Design a Dunction utilizing the the bisextion method
%function should have 3 options to stop the iterative process

%the followinf are the 3 corressponding branches

%a)An absolute approximate error to stop the process, predicint the number
%of iterations in advanses is allwed

%b)an absolute relative approximatie error is used to stop the process

%c) estimation of a true absolute error is used to stop the process


%equation 2sin(x)-e^x/(4-1)=0 has one root located [-7,-5]
%another root located in the interval [-5,-3]
